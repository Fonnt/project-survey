# Survey form with React

Survey with at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

## The problem

Diving into React Components and useState hook.
Created a counter to navigate throught the different questions.
Passing the user input into a final summary and displaying it on Submit.
Created conitional statement in order to display different outputs depending on user input.

Added responsivness. Mobile first, tablet, desktop.
Changed the styling of radio buttons into images.
Hover and checked status to radio buttons from grey to color when selected.
Added accessability.

If I had more time I would have work in:
-improving accessability even more.
-adding text anitmation (fade in or similar) when next question is displayed.
-Trying to fix a design issue with positioning the buttons always in the same place.
